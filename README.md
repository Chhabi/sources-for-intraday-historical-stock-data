Sources for Intraday Historical Stock Data

For back testing possible automated systems for use by a hedge fund, I have a need for 2 years of 1 minute intraday stock data, with at least monthly updates. I might as well publish the research I've done so far...

There is no real order below, I chose {possibly eoddata (if they can get their act together... See comment(s) below}

If you have a source that isn't listed, please add it in a comment.

Thanks,
Michael

It seems they are probably a near fraudulent entity? See the 4 comments in the thread:

Here are a few other References:

- https://www.bigmiketrading.com/421509-post14.html
- http://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/18822/why-are-quantquote-historical-trades-different-vom-activetick-historical-trades/18855

Another oddity is some of the firms on their partner list:

- Dell, Cisco, Seagate, Red Hat

This leads me to the question, "Did their VC(s) just tell them to name drop as much as possible?" Those four companies are all computer related, so any of them being a 'partner' for a financial services firm seems very odd.

For more information, you'll need to do your own digging.

And, as the person who posted the positive comment for QuantQuote below says, "Buyer beware!"

Michael

Intraday Sources

by Michael Gravis on Thu, 07/15/2010, 11:24
"Lookin for a source, preferably free, for US Equitys ticker symbols. Update weekly would be nice. Any thoughts? I would then use my RT data for data."

John, I was on a similar search a couple weeks ago and decided to go with the Pi Trading Stocks Edition (http://pitrading.com/intraday_ascii_data_stocks_edition.htm) based on the information on this blog along with my own research and other online reviews. I ordered and received the July DVD update last week. My search criteria was intraday data (minute time frame) for US stocks for use with NinjaTrader and AmiBroker. I was more interested in quality than price in my choice, but all 3 vendors are competitive.

Of the sources listed, I narrowed down to 3 intraday discount vendors: Price Data/Grain Market Research (http://price-data.com/), Pi Trading (http://pitrading.com/historical_data.htm), and Kibot (http://www.kibot.com/). I wish I could afford to look at Tick Data (http://www.tickdata.com/), but the prices are ridiculous; they even have a minimum order amount.

The deciding factor for me was the features and quality of the data. I require volume information for my back testing (OHLCV). By comparing sample data from the 3 vendors, only Pi Trading included accurate volume information for stocks. In fact, Price Data/Grain Market Research does not include the volume field. Price Date includes the following disclaimer on their page: "Data Format: Files are Comma Delimited ASCII format with a *.txt file extension. Field order is Date, Time, Open, High, Low, Close". I found a few online posts with references to issues with Kibot volume history, but I could not compare with my real-time data as the Kibot data was not synchronized on the close price of each minute bar.

Michael, Thanks for the comprehensive collection of data sources. You might be interested in the following tidbits I found when doing data search. I was only interested in intraday (minute) data, so my focus was in that area.

- Price Data/Grain Market Research does not include a volume field in their price history.
- Price Data/Grain Market Research & Pi Trading include standard session data (no pre/post market).
- Pi Trading data is updated monthly through the first Friday of the new month. A return customer discount program is available for updates.
- Price Data/Grain Market Research is updated monthly through the last weekday of the month. An automatic update program is available for updates.
- Kibot & Pi Trading data is adjusted for splits.
- Price Data/Grain Market Research does not adjust their intraday data for splits.
- Note to NinjaTraders users: NinjaTrader requires a special format for their txt data importer. Pi Trading provides a utility (free download) on their site to automate the conversion so their data can be imported into NinjaTrader. KiBot will convert their data before shipment to NinjaTrader with 24 hour turnaround.

A quick suggestion: It would be helpful if your source list was broken into intraday, end-of-day, and real-time categories.

-I hope this helps.

-Michael

Intraday data

by Guest on Sat, 07/24/2010, 17:45
Hi Michael,

We now have intraday history back to 1 Jan 2009 available for purchase: cost $10/month/exchange
Data back to 1991 is currently being loaded for AMEX, NASDAQ and NYSE.

So... within the next month we should have 1,5,10,15,30 and 60 minute bars back to 1991

Still can only order 1 month :(

by Michael on Fri, 07/30/2010, 19:17
Hi Andrew,

I already sent a support ticket, but just for readers knowledge, eoddata's order process has a bug(?), in that you can't order more than one month of intraday data. If you fill out the form for 18 months and click 'Buy', the Shopping Cart only contains a bill for one month...*

I'm sure they'll fix it soon....

Michael
* I could try to "Order" 18 times? But that seems really painful...

######## Update ###########

Subject: Re: Intraday data
Date: Sunday 01 August 2010, 7:39:15 am
From: Michael
To: eoddata.com

Hi Andrew,

Based upon your comment on my site, I signed up as a Platinum Member, and immediately ran into a few problems...

1) Using the DataClient, only the last two days of intraday data would download (AMEX, NYSE). I could get back to Jun 30th on the website single day download form, but obviously that's useless for backfilling purposes.

[FIXED: Use URL http://www.eoddata.com/myaccount/buyhistoricaldata.aspx ]
2) The Shopping cart for past intraday data has a bug. You can select 18 months on the "PURCHASE INTRADAY HISTORICAL DATA," but once you hit "BUY NOW" the shopping cart only has 1 month in it:

Type
Level
Name
Quantity
Amount

Intraday
UPGRADE
AMEX Intraday History
Add a month to intraday historical access
1
$10.00

[RESOLVED: Got a nice reply from Nick on Sunday that fixed item 2) ]
3) The web support ticket I sent in Friday was never responded to. I didn't even get the normal automated, "We've received your request, ticket # is ..."

###

I'm looking for the full 18 months of AMEX Intraday History, please call me so I can get this ordered.

Thank you,
Michael

###
[Update: Wed, Aug 4, 2010, 1:48PM EDT

Not sure I like their support much. There have been no automated replies to any tickets I've sent in, telling me they received the ticket. I've sent in 4 so far, 2 webform and 2 email, with the last ticket on their webform crashing with a 500 internal server error. I don't think they even get emailed support tickets, as the one I sent in Sun, 1 Aug 2010 07:39, still hasn't been replied too.

Current issue:
After taking a day or so for the DataClient to realize I had purchased the 18 months of AMEX data, a day or so to download the data (probs with that too) and then I find out it's not adjusted for splits.

I'm feeling like a guinea pig not a "Platinum" member...

Thanks for sharing your research.
I did similar research and looked basically into the same providers.
One you may want to also look at is e-signal (more exactly their data feeder e-data).
I see you want to research kinetick. I believe they only provide data through Ninja Trader, so useless unless this is your system.
Do you have any insight into forex data?
Thanks.

Also, free full history since 1998 is available. Great if you want to plugin their data into your software and analyze it before making an actual purchase.

Commodities Intra-Day Data

by VK on Thu, 05/31/2012, 14:52
Michael - the research you put together is excellent and I am very appreciative.

I was looking for 1 min intraday data for commodity futures (specifically CBOT grains) with a daily subscription. After extensive research, it seems only CQG and eSignal offer this product. If you or any others can find another competent source, please let me know.

Thanks,

by nocloud on Tue, 07/24/2012, 23:51
I posted this on ET (elite trader) earlier today, but since this was linked in that thread, I feel compelled to post this here as well.

In short, Kibot data is very very poor quality and I recommend everybody stay away. My customer service experience with them has been poor, problems take a long time to fix IF they fix them, and they even try to charge you money to fix their own mistakes. Google around and you can see numerous examples of bad kibot data.

I can give a thumbs up to QuantQuote (quantquote.com), at least they fix their problems quickly if you manage to find one (I have only found one so far and it was very minor) and are willing to give free support. The same really can't be said for Kibot. Buyer beware!

A new source of intraday data

by Vladimir on Mon, 02/25/2013, 17:57
Hi Michael, you probably have the best list of historical intraday data sources. Consider adding my company's offer: historical-intraday.com.

There are more than 2000 stocks in the data files and data goes back up to 2010. Data is in csv format, intervals are 1-minute. Data tested for completeness.

Price is the lowest on the market and we'll be able to provide good customer support should it be required. Price is US $149.

Vladimir, your site is so new it's not even ranked! Also, a question: How does your data account for splits? Michael

Lease Instead of Buying - More Affordable

by John on Sun, 04/06/2014, 13:01
Thanks for a great and very comprehensive list of intraday data providers.

I just want to add some notes of my own.

Buying Data:

Professional/Institutional Data. TickData.com has widest selection but very expensive. For US equities talk to QuantQuote.com

Retail: Kibot and Pi are far less expensive but the data is problematical.

Leasing Access:

Professional/Institutional: QuantGo.com gives access to years of institutional intraday data (tick and bars) for relatively low monthly price. XIgnite.com has a pay as you go model but it can get expensive quickly as you are paying per "hit".

In summary, if I only need a small amount of data one time then I will use QuantQuote.com and if I need lots of intraday data from different years or asset classes then I am using QuantGo.com

QuantQuote Review - Overall poor data quality

by Jonas on Tue, 04/29/2014, 13:16
Based on the recommendation above, I decided to purchase some price data from QuantQuote for an upcoming project. Due to the large amount of history required, we were trying to find an alternative over the traditional research vendors.

For the evaluation, I ordered the DJIA minute resolution package containing the companies from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. For the comparison, I was using historical data from previous projects as supplied by TickData and CQG. I was also using our current quote vendor (Bloomberg) but their backfill is limited.

Now for my observations:

Incorrect Dividend Adjustment Method

The data is "already" adjusted for corporate events. However, I found the adjusted history to be useless and had to revert to using unadjusted prices in my evaluation.

When trying to align the data with my other test vendors, I was unable to synchronize parts of the history. After a long walk-through of several files, I found the QuantQuote data was occasionally missing dividends. Not all declared dividends were being accounted for in the history. This problem was not limited to a single symbol. Issue confirmed using the CBOE adjustment history and CSI.

Erroneous bar data

I found several instances of the open or close of a one minute bar being outside the range. example: It is not possible to have a close price above the high of the bar. I was under the impression the data was filtered for bad-ticks.

Overall bad data quality

Performing a statistical analysis of the O-H-L-C prices between four vendors, I compared each price field individually and only used regular session history. Again, I had to compare unadjusted prices only as the QuantQuote method had too many errors to reliability align the data between sources.

I found the QuantQuote data to have an unusually high number of outliers and divergences compared with with the other vendors (TickData, Bloomberg and CQG). I plotted and analyzed my results in Excel but could not find how to post the charts in this forum.

I understand no data source is perfect, but unless you have the time and resources to manipulate the data into shape, I would avoid QuantQuote for any serious project.

Understandably, Tickdata is the best. Bloomberg is a close second is quality, but has limited intraday back-fill. I have some additional data on order from other vendors mentioned on this thread and will try to evaluate over the next few weeks.

I would welcome the experiences and suggestions on other sources to consider.

QuantQuote Review

by Fahad Mucznik on Fri, 07/04/2014, 17:14
Hi Jonas, I observed some similar traits in the QuantQuote dataset, e.g. some outliers in the data and I talked to their support team about this and figured out the reason for it.

Basically, QuantQuote has two datasets. One is the "cleaned" dataset, and the other is the "raw" dataset. For some time, they provided the raw dataset as the default since their offering are geared towards Quants. The philosophy is that since bad ticks to come in through the tape, if you are a high frequency quant trader, your algos will actually see the bad ticks. So to trade realistically, your algos should be trained on raw data.

Apparently, QuantQuote got a number of complaints about this so since May 2014, they have switched back to the clean dataset as the default, which filters out all bad ticks. I simply emailed them and asked to get data from the clean dataset instead and those files didn't have any outliers. I would recommend emailing them to ask for your data, but from the clean dataset.

Cheers,
Fahad


Quantquote

Hey Guys,

Based on the review here http://quant.caltech.edu/historical-stock-data.html, I bought data from Quantquote. Experience has been very bad. I paid $1,500 and got incomplete data and they don't reply to emails. No one picks up the phone listed on their website. Don't know what to do as they are simply absconding. If anyone has any ideas or know email of a person at QuantQuote who can help, I would be grateful.

I have to start looking for alternative and hourly resolutions are sufficient for me. Has anyone had any recent experience with Kibot, PiTrading or any other vendors? (Recent as in last 1-2 months). I have already 1,500 with Quantquote and can't afford to lose anymore money.

The reviews for Quantquote at quant.caltech.edu are fake

RS,

So sorry you had a bad experience, but no surprise. I was fooled, too. Quantquote is not a reliable company, and neither is their data.

The reviews here http://quant.caltech.edu/historical-stock-data.html are fake. The site is a scam piggybacking on CalTech's reputation. As reported on other forums, the founders of Quantquote also maintain the quant subdomain at Caltech. Can someone say conflict of interest?

Run a google search for both Quantquote and Caltech, and you will find two common denominators: Jason Stockman (CTO) and Andy Yen (Founder). And the funny thing, according to Jason Stockman's old resume, he admits designing both web sites.

Quantquote's service has been accelerating to the downside. Both founders have moved on to their next startup: encrypted emails.

Bought KIBOT for now

by rsiddh on Wed, 08/05/2015, 08:54
Even though there were some bad reviews on the internet, I took the leap of faith and bought Kibot data. It looks ok for now. Maybe because I am looking more at recent history. Will post here if I see anything problematic.

free data for shorter term

by Tim on Sat, 02/07/2015, 20:33
I didn't see anything listed for free data. There are several sites that have some free data, but generally only going back 50 days or so. The following site has some info:

http://www.quantshare.com/sa-426-6-ways-to-download-free-intraday-and-tick-data-for-the-us-stock-market

I found the google finance query to be the most complete. You can query any time period down to one-minute, but you will only receive up to 50 days of data.


a bit more

by Tim on Sun, 02/08/2015, 22:34
The 50 days was for an hourly query. It may be shorter for 1 minute...

Another site that has free data going back a few years for selected ETFs, stocks and some Forex is http://thebonnotgang.com/tbg/historical-data/
